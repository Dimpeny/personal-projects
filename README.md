# Goal
This project is website for writers, artists, game developers, roleplayers, and others who may simply enjoy worldbuilding, to be able to organize the information about the setting, characters, places, items, and other things in their projects.

# Technologies
I aim to create an `API` using `C# ASP.NET` for the Back-End, using `Microsoft SQLServer` for my Database, and finally, utilize `Angular`, `Html`, and `CSS` for the Front-End. <br>
I will also be using <a href='https://trello.com/w/charactermanagerwebsite/home'>Trello</a> to organize everything about the project.

# Project Structure

|April 27th, 2023 | Erased the placeholder text used in the main branch; Added project title, as well as adding an index pointing to the topics: Goal, Technologies, Project structure (and it's sub-topics), and Change Log; Project structure still has it's own placeholder text. |
