# Goal
This project is website for writers, artists, game developers, roleplayers, and others who may simply enjoy worldbuilding, to be able to organize the information about the setting, characters, places, items, and other things in their projects.

# Technologies
I aim to create an `API` using `C# ASP.NET` for the Back-End, using `Microsoft SQLServer` for my Database, and finally, utilize `Angular`, `Html`, and `CSS` for the Front-End. <br>
I will also be using <a href='https://trello.com/w/charactermanagerwebsite/home'>Trello</a> to organize everything about the project.

# Usage
This is an explanation of how users use each page of the website
